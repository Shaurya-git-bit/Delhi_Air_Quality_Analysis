#DELHI AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION

This project analyzes air quality trends in Delhi,India from 2015-2024 using official dataset from kaggle.It involves deep Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and basic Machine learning for prediction of AQI 

#FEATURES:
-------------EDA-------------
-Data cleaning by checking for any null values
-Finds out the main cause of high AQI using correlation
-Visualize seasonal trends and patterns to find out which months and seasons had the highest AQI 

-------------Machine Learning-------------
-Uses Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor for prediciting AQI
-Compares and Evaluates which model works better by finding out RMSE
-Visualizes the comparison using Matplotlib

#DATASET SOURCE:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kunshbhatia/delhi-air-quality-dataset

#TOOLS USED
1)Pandas-for data loading, cleaning and manupilating
2)Numpy-handling array values and mathematical calculations
3)Seaborn-For better visualization of patterns and trends in AQI 
4)Matplotlib-for visualizing comparison between prediction of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor
5)Scikit learn-for building and training models 

#RESULTS
-Highest AQI was recorded at the end of year possibly due to celebration of Diwali which involves burning of firecrackers.
-PM10 and PM2.5 shows the strongest correlation with AQI which shows that these two are the main contributors for high AQI.
-CO moderately contributes to high AQI and gases like SO2 And NO2 contributes very slightly to high AQI.
-Other gases show almost no effect on high AQI.
-Random Forest Regressor works better than Linear Regression
-Predictive model accuracy: 87% (Random Forest).

#ADDITIONAL
This project took me 10 days to finish.Did all of this by myself by learning tutorials on youtube and websites and then writing the code by myself and then asking AI if my approach was correct. it was an interesting journey
